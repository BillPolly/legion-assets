      Morning <!here>


      Sorry about this but our accountants have had some personnel issues and
      are hoping to sort out payroll today which means that your salaries won’t
      land until later today (possibly tomorrow). Rather out of our control very
      annoyingly.


      Apologies for this :disappointed:

      actually use the code gemini creates - but being able to run this in
      literally 10 seconds was so easy.

      'pro' fixed it immediately

      Tiny but cool win for Gemini experimentation. I was fed up of creating
      forms in Google forms manually. I asked Gemini if there was a way I could
      automate creating the form.


      I got it to build the set of questions and options and then it gave me all
      the code to run in <https://script.google.com/> - once I'd given it the
      permissions it created the form for me perfectly.
