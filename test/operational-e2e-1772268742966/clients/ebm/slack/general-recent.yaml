      Hi <!here> I'm off on Monday so here are a few things on my list for next week:
      • Internet Matters - <@U04H93UTPRD> and <@U04HH26R878> - see the feedback in the shared channel. Call with client to discuss at 11am Monday. Would be great to address some of these over the first half of next week. I will discuss budget with Ghislaine on Tues but we are fine to committing more time on this atm.
      • BMA - <@U04HPRCC7NY> - would be good to get the updates made to the prompt and deployed to BMA Dev. Not urgent for Mon but would be ideal for next week
          ◦ <@U04H93UTPRD> I have raised a ticket with their latest UAT feedback - some things to review / investigate. Less urgent than Internet Matters but if it turns out you don't have IM to do, then please take a look: <https://ebmai.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/BMA1/boards/307?selectedIssue=BMA1-87>
      • NASUWT - <@U04HPRCC7NY> - I have added a ticket to update the scrape list. Would be good for this to get done before the next scrape (on Weds?) as she has people testing it atm: <https://ebmai.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/NASUWT/boards/126?issueParent=21602%2C24168&amp;selectedIssue=NASUWT-36>
      • Technicians - <@U0A09M0JJ2U> - if you could give my 'requirements' doc a once-over and let me know if it's detailed enough, that would be great
      • CYBER ESSENTIALS PLUS - the audit is coming up on 11th March and we will need to audit 2 out of the 3 of <@U04HR5E5FCM> <@U04H93UTPRD> and <@U0A09M0JJ2U> laptops. Therefore please all try to get MS Defender set up, let me know if you face any errors (I might need to up your permissions)
      Thanks all and catch up on Tuesday :v:

  - text: well done <@U04HPRCC7NY>... and <@U04HR5E5FCM> / <@U04H93UTPRD> let me
      know if you need to do this as I'll likely need to bump up your privileges
      first

  - text: <@U04HH2751T8> I've got the tick on MS defender. I needed to uninstall it
      and follow the reinstall steps from before. <@U04HR5E5FCM> and
      <@U04H93UTPRD> let me know if you need help doing this. I have a feeling
      the same thing has happened to you where the updates stopped for some
      reason. MS defender should be on 2026
