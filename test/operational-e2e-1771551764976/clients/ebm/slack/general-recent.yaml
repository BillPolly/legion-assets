      Hi all <!here> I've sent you all an invite for our Cyber Essentials Plus
      audit on 11th March as we'll likely need a variety of you to join the call
      at different times to show system logins etc.


      I will start getting us all prepped next week. In terms of the specific
      machines to be sampled, they will be:

      • Me

      • <@U04HEPK09PG> 

      • <@U04HH26R878> 

      • <@U04H93UTPRD> (if you have your new computer by then, otherwise
      <@U04HR5E5FCM>)

      • <@U04HPRCC7NY> 

      Stay tuned for more!
