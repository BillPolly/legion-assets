  - text: <@U04HH2751T8> I've got the tick on MS defender. I needed to uninstall it
      and follow the reinstall steps from before. <@U04HR5E5FCM> and
      <@U04H93UTPRD> let me know if you need help doing this. I have a feeling
      the same thing has happened to you where the updates stopped for some
      reason. MS defender should be on 2026

      Morning <!here>


      Sorry about this but our accountants have had some personnel issues and
      are hoping to sort out payroll today which means that your salaries won’t
      land until later today (possibly tomorrow). Rather out of our control very
      annoyingly.


      Apologies for this :disappointed:
